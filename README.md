## ⚙️ Tech Stack

* **Backend:** Django, Django REST Framework
* **Database:** PostgreSQL
* **Auth:** Django Authentication + Groups
* **Environment:** python-decouple
* **Version Control:** Git & GitHub

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Besso2003/Clinic_Appointment_System_Python.git
cd Clinic_Appointment_System_Python
```

---

### 2️⃣ Create Virtual Environment

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

Activate:

**Windows**

```bash
venv\Scripts\activate
```

**Linux / Mac**

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

---

### 3️⃣ Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

### 4️⃣ Setup Environment Variables

Create `.env` file in project root like `.env.example`:

```env
DB_NAME=clinic_db
DB_USER=clinic_user
DB_PASSWORD=your_password
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=5432
SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
```

---

### 5️⃣ Setup PostgreSQL Database

Create database and user:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE clinic_db;
CREATE USER clinic_user WITH PASSWORD 'your_password';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE clinic_db TO clinic_user;
```

---

### 6️⃣ Apply Migrations

```bash
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```

---

### 7️⃣ Run Development Server

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

Open in browser:

```
http://127.0.0.1:8000/
```

---

## 🔐 Roles & Permissions

The system relies on **Django Groups** plus the built-in permission framework. A management
command (`python manage.py create_groups`) will create the four groups and give them the
appropriate model permissions (e.g. `add_appointment`, `change_appointment`, etc.) so that
access can be enforced declaratively.

Members are added to a group automatically when they register (the registration form
assigns the user based on the `role` field), or you can update group membership via the
admin. Once in a group, `user.has_perm('app_label.codename')` returns `True` for all permissions
assigned to that group.  Use Django's helpers (`@permission_required`,
`PermissionRequiredMixin`, manual `has_perm()` calls) in your views and model clean methods to
check for sufficent rights rather than relying on the `role` field alone.
